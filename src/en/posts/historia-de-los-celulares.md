## Introduction

The cell phone ... that device that is so necessary today, that it is even part of us, we carry it everywhere and we even fall asleep next to it. A device that is undoubtedly revolutionizing the way of life, because it does everything and you carry it in your pocket, it is your wallet, a professional camera, a computer, music player, movie player, books and you can also make calls. Let's see the evolution of cell phones.

## First cell phone

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://innovationtechnologiquestp.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/handie_talkie_h12-16.jpg', alt: 'SmartPhone' }" />

In 1940 the first communication device had radio waves that did not exceed 60 MHz, it was used for war. Before this equipment, radio systems were used which worked through amplitude modulation (AM frequencies), but later frequency modulation (FM waves) was used to achieve a greater range of reach and precision of the service.

In 1946, the Bell Labs company of AT&T implemented a technology that was telephones in cars, it was called System Service, landlines but in cars, only people with more money had it since it was an extremely expensive service, that is why lasted until 1885.

Now we go 47 years back in time, when in 1973 Motorola launched the first cell phone in the world, but the pioneer was Bell Laboratories obtained its patent in 1972, the curious thing is that Motorola made its first call to the Bell Laboratories competition from AT&T, Marty Cooperâ€“ Motorola R&D Vice President makes a phone call to Joel Engel, AT&T Chief Engineer and mobile phone developer.

It was not until 1984 that the Motorola DynaTac 8000X began to be sold to the public. Attention to the dimensions of this: 1 kilogram and measured 33 x 4.4 x 8.9 centimeters, the battery only lasted one hour of use, and it only made calls, which today is being replaced by instant messaging or video calls. A few months later, the competition between AT&T and Motorola ends as it was decided that Motorola would keep the devices and AT&T with the phone service.

##  1G

Currently all cell phones have 4G, but initially you could only make calls and not everywhere in many places there was no signal, but this led to a very large evolution since the number belonged to one person. The famous company Ericsson launched the 450 MHz Nordic Mobile Telephony system, it used analog radio channels, through FM frequency modulation, in 1986 it evolved to NMT 900 this is important since this gives rise to the evolution of the bands.

## 2G or second generation

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://files.lafm.com.co/assets/public/2019-03/celular_la_fm_afp_.jpg', alt: 'SmartPhone' }" />

This generation was where it exploded and people wanted to have a cell phone, the telephone was still being used a lot, but it was this decade of the 90s that cell phones began to be much more accessible and of reasonable size, this is also due to the fact that the telephone improved a lot. quality of the bands since frequencies of 900 and 1800 MHz were used, the famous GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) system currently used throughout the world was included, this gives the birth of mobile telephone companies.

## 2.5 G known as Transition Generation

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://www.monografias.com/trabajos109/dispositivos-moviles-celulares-evolucion-sus-tecnologias/image007.jpg', alt: 'SmartPhone' }" />

In this era of transition, EMS text messages were incorporated, which would become SMS, something that we do not use today, with the addition of MMS, multimedia files could be sent, it had 384 Kbps in transfer speed, today it is nothing.

## 3G 

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://i.blogs.es/1b0027/desbloqueo/500_333.jpeg', alt: 'SmartPhone' }" />

A huge leap, internet connectivity anywhere, the transmission of data was much greater, for the first time web browsing, emails, browsing apps was done, it was the inflection point to be today as we communicate.

The popular cell phones of the time were the BlackBerry, a company that at the time gave sales competition to the giant Apple, these cell phones had social networks and their own messaging.

## 4G and 4G +

Generation that is in use and will continue like this for a few more years, if you are observers before, what marked the change of a new generation was the infrastructure, that is, the antennas, when it was changed from 2 G to 3 G it was because the infrastructure already existed in the place, but it is not the case with 4 G and 5 G, cell phones are prepared with the technology to receive high amounts of data but there is still no infrastructure. 4 G theoretically reaches 100 Mbits / s in movement up to the incredible figure of 1 Gb / s in idle, so it is if you are moving the amount of data decreases.

This generation totally broke with the scheme of how we consume, currently we can watch high resolution videos, listen to music, make video calls and do shopping, this generation made us strengthen strong ties with technology and how we relate to each other.

## 5G

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://innovacionchilena.cl/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5G.jpg', alt: 'SmartPhone' }" />

Generation that according to experts will revolutionize the way we live, this network is very interesting for all that it can bring (IoT), because the data transfer speeds are extremely fast (surfing the Internet at speeds of up to 20 Gbps) and in very few places exist this network. In this network, the latency factor is extremely low, that is, the sending and receiving of data is very fast compared to 4G.

This network will have a dedicated post, with the aim of developing what awaits us in the future.
