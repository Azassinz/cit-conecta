## Introduction

The supercomputer is already a reality, and it is getting closer and closer to becoming a super tool that can mark a significant change in the history of computers and even human beings. A year ago IBM presented the first commercial quantum computer, it can be said that quantum computing has years of study, 40 years to be exact.

## What is it?

Let's go in parts, Jack would say, a super computer or quantum computer works with qubits, that is, it can be 1 as well as 0 at the same time in a qubit. It is somewhat complicated to understand, let's start with the operation of a normal computer ... In today's digital world everything is handled by bits 1 and 0, binary language, that is, it is or it is not, that simple, our world is governed in the same way Let's give an example, a light bulb can be on or off we have 1 and 0, these accumulate in large quantities 101010001110 and when they arrive at the computer it is interpreted by a processor.

##  Processor

This device that Revolutionized the whole world, the processors are a set of many transistors, but at nano size, remember from bits 1 and 0, well the interpretation comes out of these, there are several types of transistors and, or, not etc. When receiving a signal, whether it is on (1) or off (0), they will give a response of either 1 or 0 depending on their type. This is much more complex than the processors and it gives for an individual publication, if you would like us to make one, leave a comment.

Over the years, companies have managed to miniaturize transistors, to the point that any cell phone today is faster than the computer that was used to reach the moon, but these nanometric transistor processors have a limitation, physics , says that the minimum size is 14 nm 300 times that of a red blood cell, limits of physics establish that from certain sizes it is known that the quantum effects in the atoms of which these transistors are composed will make their operation unviable. The incredible thing is that we are getting closer and closer to that number.

Well, knowing the basics of how processors work, let's continue with the qubits, we said that these can have 2 values ​​simultaneously, this means that they can represent all the intermediate states, that's where things start to get a bit messy, try to follow me . There are 2 quantum systems, the qubits, these 2 are related to each other, as long as this is not defined, in that case the quantum bond is broken. This is why they can do impossible processes for a common computer, it is because it can be in several states, it has quantum entanglement and superposition, it does not give it more speed but it gives it more processing field.

But there is a problem, the error, because they can be very fast, but the quantum entanglement between the qubits has to be correct, that is, the conditions have to be correct, otherwise it does not work, the challenge is not just adding qubits to the computer If not precise, any interference damages operations, for that the giant Google has developed a correction system that claims to be 99.99% assertive.

## How are they built?

<lazy-load tag="img" :data="{ src: 'https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/uploads/2019/01/16/4baf54f3691547659025.jpeg' , alt: 'Supercomputer'}" />

They need to be isolated from all possible noise and hyperconducting materials, it has a special superconducting chip that only works at absolute zero, that is, at 273 degrees below zero, where superconductivity occurs, this is only achieved with liquefied helium in a metal cylinder.

### Trademarks

IBM Q launched this first commercial model, since in 3 or 5 years the company assumes that it will be possible to see them in the field of production and not in a laboratory.

Google, Rigetti Computing use the method of superconduction of the material, but it is not the only method of bringing the qubit into a controlled space, also IonQ, traps individual atoms in electromagnetic fields on a silicon chip in ultra-high vacuum chambers.

If up to this point you have not understood much, do not worry, the concept of superposition and mainly that of quantum bonding, nobody understands it completely, it breaks with the way of understanding the world, and that is how it is currently with quantum we come to understand some things, as Bohr said "If someone is not confused with quantum physics, it is because they have not understood it well." They are behaviors that we cannot understand, they only occur in the world of subatomic particles, so yes… we do not understand the totality of a quantum computer.

## For what?

Now comes the really interesting thing, it can be something very innovative and surprising, but if it does not have an application it is useless, that is not the case with the quantum computer, in fact, quite the opposite. Companies like Samsung invest in this type of project to be pioneers in the use of these computers in a few years.

The super computer has space in everything that a common computer calculates approximations or has calculations of many years, that is:

### Material design

A material is used for its type of behavior to electricity, resistance, etc. but with this super PC it is possible to understand the interaction through a subatomic particle within a molecule, that is to say that new materials will not be discovered, but rather they will be designed.

### Finance

There are many calculations that are made roughly, for example, financial calculation modeling, with the new capabilities you can reach an exact result.

### Machine Learning

A very limited aspect is machine learning since it must analyze large amounts of images, text, audios and videos in order to serve a search engine or the benefit of the company, with qubitz multisectoral machine learning can be greatly enhanced .

### Pharmaceutical

The industry that would benefit the most from this type of computer is pharmaceuticals, since molecules could be simulated and the process of making medicines accelerated, since nowadays it is not possible to do simulations even of the water molecule.

## Conclusions

Will they replace current computers? Probably not, since they are not useful in all cases, in fact, it is currently very difficult to get a quantum computer to work in a stable way for a few hours, only programs are used for testing.
